# GeoFurlong

Geospatial resources for mainline (Network Rail) railways in Britain.

## Description

This repository contains the source-code for the builder process, which transforms multiple geospatial data sources into optimised datasets for client application use. These output datasets are stored on [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/1tzbnx4zaz61nwslqobn9/AOcmAULa79IuAjLNIvZThRQ?rlkey=fx8e3gxwhtgmlq2v0akv827ty&dl=0) and summarised in the [Data Catalogue](#data-catalogue) section below.

The output datasets provide ready-made geocoded data for railway locations, formed of an [Engineer's Line Reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineer%27s_Line_Reference) (ELR) and associated mileage (or kilometreage) on that line. These precomputed geographic positions can be reverse-geocoded to establish the railway ELR and mileage relative to other features using standard nearest neighbour or point-in-polygon spatial analysis using GIS tools or software libraries.

Sample applications will be shared via separate repositories which utilise the geocoded datasets, dynamic geocoding (at several thousand points per second), and reverse geocoding for mobile applications.

üåê [geofurlong.com](https://www.geofurlong.com/) is built using the output of this project, with interactive mapping of routes and junction areas, tabulated output detailing railway attributes, and spatial relationship with populated places and government administrative boundaries.

## Preface

GeoFurlong uses a _total yards_ value to define the reported linear distance along the railway, commonly referred to as a _mileage_, even for kilometre-based ELRs. This is a signed whole number which avoids the pitfalls associated with attempting to store mileage in the many permutations of decimal miles, fractional miles, or text format. These pitfalls are amplified when dealing with negative mileages. The _total yards_ unit is unambiguous, and efficient for sorting, filtering, and storage within systems.

GeoFurlong is opinionated and consistent in its textual presentation of mileages. For example, a mileage of `86 miles`, `7 yards` is presented as `86M 0007y`.

Recording of geographic position is [precise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision) to one decimal place for Ordnance Survey Easting / Northing (i.e. 100 mm) and six decimal places for Longitude / Latitude (approximately 110 mm in Britain).

Linear accuracy is defined as the geographic measured distance versus the reported distance, both in metres. For example, if the measured distance between neighbouring quarter mileposts along an ELR centre-line was `403.836 metres`, the accuracy would be calculated as `+1.5 metres` (as a quarter mile being 440 yards, or `402.336 metres`). This is an example of what is commonly referred to as a _long quarter mile_. The linear accuracy, computed to maximum available decimal places, is used to produce the linear calibration statistics per ELR; it is subsequently truncated to a whole number for presentation in other data sets.

The computed geographic position for a defined ELR and mileage may not be accurate in all instances. In a number of locations, the position may be incorrect by a significant linear distance, particularly on closed or partially-closed lines. The manually-maintained _ELR_ dataset (via the `Remarks` column) identifies ELRs which exhibit potentially poor accuracy.

The build process computes the estimated linear position for a given mileage on an ELR by calibrating against mileposts on that ELR. For each ELR, calibration in undertaken using the virtual centre-line geometry, reported start and finish mileages, combined with the milepost position and value. The computed geographic distance along the segment between mileposts are compared against the reported mileages for the mileposts and recorded in a detailed calibration statistics database. This calibration process allows an estimation of the linear accuracy to be provided when geocoding from ELR and Mileage to geographic position.

Noting the linear calibration process described above, inaccuracies in estimating geographic position of a mileage on an ELR can result as a consequence of individual or combined factors which are out with the control of this project, including:

- **ELR**: Incorrect geometry; incorrect start / finish reported mileage; remodelled track layout.
- **Milepost**: Incorrect position; incorrect identifier; not recorded / physically missing.

>‚ö†Ô∏è Given these credible risks to positional accuracy, the GeoFurlong datasets must not be used for safety-critical decisions, nor relied upon as the primary geographic data source in production environments.

### Aggregated Gazetteer

At the maximum resolution of 22 yards, the gazetteer table consists of over 850,000 entries. An alternative method of establishing the geographic context of the railway positions is made available by grouping the following attributes into a mileage range: Network Rail Region, Government Administrative Area, and nearest Populated Place (and its corresponding County / District) in the following tables, each which have a significantly reduced number of entries:

- `geofurlong_gazetteer_by_nr_region.csv`
- `geofurlong_gazetteer_by_country_admin_area.csv`
- `geoofurlong_gazetteer_by_nearest_place.csv`

### To Do

Supplementary files will be distributed to support sample client and third-party applications:

- Production database (SQLite format).
- Geospatial databases at varying yardage intervals (GeoPackage format) for `precomputed` and `gazetteer` tables.
- Improved linear positioning accuracy could be obtained by utilising more recent surveyed position of mileposts. Milepost positions are regularly surveyed as a matter of course during topographic survey on the network. The process of collating and overriding milepost positions to improve the calibration accuracy is currently not within the scope of this project.

## Builder Technical Details

### Software Stack

GeoFurlong is primarily developed in the [Go](https://go.dev/) programming language, delegating certain input and output geospatial file operations to [Python](https://www.python.org/) scripts, utilising well-proven libraries. Input data files are in ESRI [Shapefile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile) format, intermediate files as comma-separated value ([CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values)) format, and output files predominantly as [SQLite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQLite) databases (with geometry columns stored in well-known binary ([WKB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_geometry)) format).

### Process

- Manual validation / preparation (see below).
- Conversion of source geospatial to optimised SQLite format: ELRs, Mileposts, Network Rail Regions, Ordnance Survey Administrative Areas, and Ordnance Survey Populated Places.
- Calibrate mileposts along each ELR centre-line geometry to maximise linear positional accuracy.
- Build optimised production database of ELRs and associate linear calibration.
- Precompute geographic positions for all ELRs at multiple yardage intervals: 22, 110, 220, 440, 1760 (one mile), and 8800 (5 miles).
- Build a gazetteer of railway positions combining Network Railway Region, Ordnance Survey Administrative Area and Populated Place datasets at multiple yardage intervals: 22, 110, 220, 440, 1760 (one mile), and 8800 (5 miles).
- Build an aggregated gazetteer, based on 22 yard intervals.

### Source Data Preparation

The Scottish Region geometry from the Network Rail data source has been identified as being invalid due to it containing a self-intersecting ring. This has been manually corrected prior to the data import phase using [QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/).

Several populated places are present which share a common geographic position within the Ordnance Survey data source. These have been assessed manually, then removed prior to the data import phase, as noted in the table below.

### Data Usage

For most applications, end-users will likely utilise the files contained in the `data/precomputed` or `data/gazetteer` directories, as these contain pre-computed geographic information for regular points (at multiple resolutions) along each ELR. These ready-made tabular files provide simple lookup access to geographic positions for ELRs and mileages without the need for any complex computation.

In addition to these files, developers may use the database in `data/production`, combined with the Go library files in `pkg/geocode` for custom applications to compute the geographic position of an ELR and mileage combination dynamically. This library exposes function to establish a `point` for a single mileage or `substring` for a mileage range. Client libraries for other programming languages are in progress to integrate with the database in `data/production`.
